# Microtubule-Dynamics
**Abstract:** The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is essential in eukaryotic cell trafficking and organization. Our lab is interested in understanding the role that αβ-tubulin’s conformational change play in MT dynamics. To do so, in this work, we
purified an αβ-tubulin mutant that had been previously characterized genetically to study its polymerization dynamics in vitro. We found that although they elongated somewhat slower than wild-type MTs, the mutant MTs were very stable: little to no catastrophe was observed and the mutant polymerized more robustly than wild-type at comparable concentration. Because the mutated site is distant from any MT assembly interfaces, our observations may indicate that the mutant more readily adopts the straight αβ-tubulin conformation, the form which favors MT polymerization.
